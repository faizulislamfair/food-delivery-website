## 🎨 Design

<p>
    The design of this app was created using FIGMA. The design was created after a discussion with the product owner to get a sense of requirements for the final product. The basic branding of the service was done first. The information architecture of the website was then structured after conducting study on a few products in the same category. The design was implemented after getting a clear idea about the product.
