## 🎨 Design

<p>
    The design of this app was created using FIGMA. The design was created after a discussion with the product owner to get a sense of requirements for the final product. The basic branding of the service was done first. The information architecture of the website was then structured after conducting study on a few products in the same category. The design was implemented after getting a clear idea about the product.

## 📝 Jira Project Board
Jira project board is a tool that was used throughout the development process. Jira's project management capabilities allowed us to plan, track, and prioritize tasks in an organized and efficient manner.

With Jira we were able to create user stories, set project milestones, and manage sprints. The tool's customizable dashboards and reports provided real-time visibility into the project's progress, allowing us to make data-driven decisions and adjust priorities as needed.

Jira also enabled seamless collaboration amongst the team members, allowing us to communicate about project updates and issues directly within the platform.

Overall, Jira proved to be an invaluable asset to this project, enabling streamlined project management and fostering effective team collaboration.

## 🔄 Sprint Retrospective
The purpose of sprint retrospectives was to help the team grow and improve, while also providing a space to celebrate successes and build team morale.

We have used [Metro Retro](https://metroretro.io/) as sprint retrospective collaboration tool.
